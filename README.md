# OpenWebRX Waterfalls

This is a small collection of tools for looking into openwebrx data from openly avaliable apis online. 
The purpose of this collection is to explore and learn about radio spectrum and waterfall data from live sources.

## Explore

To follow my journey, open up the explore notebook and work your way through it. 


## Ambitions

My ambitions with this project is to create a collection engine that can attach and listen to selected sensors. Then I want to explore what kind of analysis can be done on this data over time.
